# Using Sidenotes in huap

Sidenotes are simple markers that huap expands into HTML wrappers.

[sidenote]

This block will render as a sidenote container in the final HTML.
Use it for callouts, asides, or extra context that should stand out.

[/sidenote]

You keep writing normal Markdown after that.

## Why this is useful

- Keep the main flow short.
- Move context into a visual aside.
- Keep source readable with plain text markers.

[sidenote]

Sidenote tags must sit on their own lines.
